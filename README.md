# kitty-text


## project idea/description
What type of app would encourage people to once again, give up their personal email to try out?  I was suggested a cat rating app... like Rate-My-Chonk but it made me realize that I would be making another project that would exclude those who may be visually disabled or rely on assistive technology. This is my attempt to bridge that gap.  

It still involves ratings!  But instead of images, the user will be given prompts/[alt-texts] of cat images, and they will write a caption from just the prompt. Once entered, the actual image will show and users can vote on their favorite caption.  It's madlib sort of...with pictures... i don't know. :D

Users can continue to write captions or they can go "dev-mode" and write great alt-texts for other users.  This might be a stretch goal.

Hopefully, this will be entertaining to all participants including those using screen readers.
